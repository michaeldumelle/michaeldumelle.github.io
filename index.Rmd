I am a statistician for the Freshwater Ecology Branch of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, primarily working on [National Aquatic Resource Surveys](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys).  My main research interests are spatial statistics, survey design, and software development.  I also enjoy applying statistical methodology to collaborative work in a variety of other scientific fields.
